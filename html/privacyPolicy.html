- Website Visitors<br>
Like most website operators, ARdvark Learning collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. ARdvark Learning’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how ARdvark Learning’s visitors use its website. From time to time, ARdvark Learning may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
ARdvark Learning also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://ardvarklearning.net blog posts. ARdvark Learning only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

- Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information<br>
Certain visitors to ARdvark Learning’s websites choose to interact with ARdvark Learning in ways that require ARdvark Learning to gather personally-identifying information.
